Annual Executive Summary





2009

Introduction

The Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program traces its roots to Fairfax County. In 1972, it became the site of one of 35 national “Alcohol Safety Action Projects” funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). On March 24, 1975, legislation passed by the General Assembly expanded this program statewide establishing driver education and rehabilitation programs in an effort to reduce the number of highway tragedies.

There are currently 24 Alcohol Safety Action Programs throughout Virginia. Every jurisdiction in the Commonwealth is covered. They have the responsibility of doing everything they can to lower the number of impaired drivers on our roadways. Efforts have paid off because the number of DUI deaths in Virginia continues to decline each year.

In 1986, the General Assembly formed the Commission on Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program (Commission on VASAP). This provided for the standardization of ASAP operations, increasing the quality and equity of services to offenders statewide. Section 18.2-271.2 of the Code of Virginia requires the Commission on VASAP to submit to the Governor and the General Assembly an annual executive summary of the interim activity and work of the Commission.

This report provides an overview of Commission on VASAP activities during 2009.
